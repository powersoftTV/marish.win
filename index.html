                <div class="col-md-8 border">I have always been a big fan of Ghibli's animation style and character design. I wanted to buy their merchandise for a long time, but they were very expensive, so I made one myself! It is a desk light made from clay and materials used for soldering. It requires a 9-volt battery at the bottom of the log and has a switch on the side to turn it on. The wire that connects the battery and the light runs through the branch. The branch was connected to the log using epoxy resin. </div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">This was a project I started at the request of my boss. She needed a new bedboard and asked me to make it. I was working under the studio during my working hours, so it took some time to finish. She wanted a striped, symmetrical wooden bedboard with a place for lights and outlets. She also wanted some matching bedside tables with shelves. It was the first time I got to work on such a big project. It was so exciting, and it was also the first time I got to work in such a large area. I do not have any pictures of the finished product, but my boss was very pleased with the result.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">I made this little notebook when I got a feather pen as a present. I thought a steampunk-style notebook would be a perfect match. I grabbed an old princess notebook and ripped out all the princess-themed papers. I painted the cover, and while it was drying, I cut out a bunch of papers to fit the notebook and dumped it into black tea. I glued everything together, and now I have a cool notebook.</div>

Some were made with colorful clay, while others had to be painted. I am still learning to perfect the balance of the characters, but I improve with each figurine.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">This house was a little experiment for me. I wanted to learn how to use a laser to cut and engrave wood. It was a really interesting and new learning experience. I had to learn how to use Photoshop to create a properly measured outline of this house. I also had to make another outline of the house with the lines that I did not want cut (like the door). It was fun learning how to control the laser and how to use Photoshop.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">I made a couple of magnets. The ones on top are made of wood and were made during a time when I first got into K-pop. I made two finger hearts and a little character wearing a bear hat. At the bottom is a magnet of a cat looking out a window. I made this one out of polymer clay. This magnet was made in honor of my cat, who passed away in April.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">I found a little mirror and decided to make a wooden frame for it. I engraved a little design at the top and added a little shelf. I also made a little alien to put on the shelf. I think it turned out really cute and is a nice touch to the otherwise boring room.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">This is a secret room between a broken wall and a wall of shelves. It is made of picture frames, cardboard, wood, and clay. There is also a fish tank made out of epoxy resin and a gramophone made of polymer clay. I had a lot of fun making this house. I liked the aesthetic, and I was able to give it a working light.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">I made this doll house when I was in elementary school. Because I made it as a young child, it has many flaws, but I think it is important to show that my love for crafts goes way back. When I was little, I loved doll houses and was jealous of my friends who had those fancy toys. One day, I decided to fix my problem and built a doll house with a small sink and cabinets. I was very happy that I was able to make my own entertainment.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">This well-shaped bucket was my first work with epoxy resin. It was my learning experience, and I loved working with this material. The outside well and swing are made out of wood. The koi fish and cats are made of polymer clay. The water was made using epoxy resin.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">Here is another well with more koi fish! This time, the well itself is made of clay instead of wood. I did my best to make the well and the water look old and abandoned. I added some crushed, dried leaves to the bottom and around the well.</div>

                <div class="col-md-8 border">I believe you already noticed a bit of a pattern with the koi fish. This time the koi fish is surrounded by rocks that I randomly decided to collect. There is also a Sakura tree I made from wires. I saw the twisting wires trick online and wanted to give it a try. If I were to make the tree again, I would definitely use more wires and make the branches thicker and denser.</div>

This pot is made of clay, and I really like the idea of making it a book. And, of course, I had to make the book a classic, Sherlock Holmes. I am thinking of making more plant pots that do not look like pots.</div>
